### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in building simple (whenever possible), robust and scalable distributed systems. I currently mostly do fullstack web development. 

I consider myself a pragmatic multi-paradigm developer. Most of my programming experience has been in TypeScript, Rust, Java and Scala, with some dabbling in the functional world (Haskell, Clojure).
